# Simple-Shell
************************

This is a team project by Chaimaa Boustane & Mohamed Ali Ben Rochd

Goal: coding a simple UNIX command interpreter.

Status: Currently displays a prompt, and handles command lines with arguments (such as "/bin/ls -l"),
handles "exit" with or without arguments. Does not handle spaces only as a command " ".
Running: echo "/bin/ls" | ./shell works, but prints an unwanted line at the end.
